Feature: Mysql - Verify Mysql source data transfer to Big Query

  @MYSQL_SOURCE
  Scenario: To verify replication of snapshot and cdc data from MySQL to Big Query successfully
    Given Open DataFusion Project with replication to configure pipeline
    When Enter input plugin property: "name" with value: "pipelineName"
    And Click on the button "Next"
    And Select Source plugin: "MySQL" from the replication plugins list
    Then Replace input plugin property: "host" with value: "mysqlHost" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "port" with value: "mysqlPort" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "select-jdbcPluginName" with option value: "mysqlDriverName"

    Then Deploy the replication pipeline
    And Run the replication Pipeline
    Then Open the logs
    And Wait till pipeline is in running state and check if no errors occurred
##    Then Verify expected MySQL records in target BigQuery table
#    And Run insert, update and delete CDC events on source table
#    And Wait till CDC events are reflected in BQ
##    Then Verify expected Oracle records in target BigQuery table
    And Capture raw logs
    Then Close the pipeline logs and stop the pipeline
