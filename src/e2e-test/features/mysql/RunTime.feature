@Mysql
Feature: Mysql - Verify Mysql source data transfer to Big Query

  @MYSQL_SOURCE @MYSQL_DELETE @BQ_SINK_TEST
  Scenario: To verify replication of snapshot data from MySQL to Big Query successfully
    Given Open DataFusion Project with replication to configure pipeline
    When Enter input plugin property: "name" with pipelineName
    And Click on the button "Next"
    And Select Source plugin: "MySQL" from the replication plugins list
    Then Replace input plugin property: "host" with value: "mysqlHost" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "port" with value: "mysqlPort" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "select-jdbcPluginName" with option value: "mysqlDriverName"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "database" with value: "mysqlDatabaseName"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "user" with value: "mysqlUsername" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "password" with value: "mysqlPassword" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    And Click on the button "Next"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "project" with value: "projectId"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "datasetName" with value: "dataset"
    And Click on the button "Next"
    Then Validate Source table is available and select it
    And Click on the button "Next"
    And Click on the button "Next"
    Then Wait till the Review Assessment page is loaded in replication
    And Click on the button "Next"
    Then Deploy the replication pipeline
    And Run the replication Pipeline
    Then Open the Advanced logs
    And Wait till pipeline is in running state and check if no errors occurred
#    Then Verify expected MySQL records in target BigQuery table
    And Open and capture logs
    Then Close the replication pipeline logs and stop the pipeline

#    Then Verify expected MySQL records in target BigQuery table
    And Run insert, update and delete CDC events on source table
    And Wait till CDC events are reflected in BQ
#    Then Verify expected MySQL records in target BigQuery table
    And Open and capture logs
    Then Close the replication pipeline logs and stop the pipeline
